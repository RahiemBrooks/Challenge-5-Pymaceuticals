# Challenge-5-Pymaceuticals
This repository contains data analysis performed using Pandas and Matplotlib for Challenge 5. The focus of this challenge was to prepare the data and create visualizations to perform analysis.
The analysis is based on the data provided in two CSV files for Pymaceuticals Inc. about 249 mice which were tested in this study to compare the performance of Capomulin (the drug of interest) against other treatment regimens.
An overall summary and key observations from the analysis are included in the beginning of the notebook.
